Edits made to kanjidic2.xml:
    Removed xml elements, leaving only the kanji and the grade on the same line
    Some kanji had no grade association, so I made those grade 11
    Edited file is called kanjitrim.txt

Edits made to kradfile:
    Deleted preface to make parsing easier
    Used dataTrimmer.py and kanjitrim.txt to parse kradfile into kradfile1, kradfile2, and so on
    Each split has only the kanji used by that grade level
